[] isolate cheat AI from code
    just modify spinner vals from outside when cheating, like cheatengine

[X] pick point from color wheel based on segment start point
    offscreen canvas with radial gradient, get color at point
    just use HSL you neanderthal

    gauranteed varied colors
    - similar colours next to eachother in larger sets might look bad?
        offset scramble or something when it starts looking shit?

[] nice design
    pick a color scheme
    pick a design language
